Scientists have discovered a new strain of a dangerous virus that has contaminated oysters in the Mid-Atlantic. The Center for Disease Control is trying to prevent as much contamination as possible by tracking down all the oysters.

In this area, luckily only 6 restaurants usually buy oysters from the contaminated area: 
Restaurant A ordered 10 crates, 
Restaurant B ordered 8, 
Restaurant C ordered 5, 
Restaurant D ordered 2,
Restaurant E ordered 1, and
Restaurant F ordered 0.

The supervisor for this county asks his inspectors, "Where should we check for contaminated oysters?”

Inspector A says, “RANDOM ANSWER”
Inspector B says, “RANDOM ANSWER”
Inspector C says, “RANDOM ANSWER”

Who knows where to look for oysters? (choose all that apply)
