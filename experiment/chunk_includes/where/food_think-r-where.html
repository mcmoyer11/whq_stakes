    <p>Livia is a food journalist, and frequently has to travel to different cities for her job, interviewing chefs and tasting their culinary creations. She has four restaurants on her itinerary for a trip to New York City: Nina's, The Speckled Egg, Two for the Win, Scrumptuous, and Cloud 3. It turns out that Nina's has closed, so she doesn't go there.</p>
    
    <p>Her partner, Melissa, thinks that Livia went to Nina's.</p>
    <p>Melissa says to their friend Santiago, "Livia ate at Nina's, The Speckled Egg, Two for the Win, Scrumptuous, and Cloud 3"</p>
