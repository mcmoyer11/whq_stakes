<h3>Acquisition, Development, and Representation of Linguistic Knowledge</h3>
<h4><u>INFORMED CONSENT FORM</u> &#8212; Adults, Non-Subject Pool (Paid), Online II</h4>

<div style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto;" >
<p>You are invited to participate in a research study that is being conducted by Dr. Kristen Syrett, an Associate Professor in the Department of Linguistics and the Center for Cognitive Science at Rutgers University New Brunswick. The purpose of this research is to investigate what children and adults understand about aspects of meaning in their native language and how this knowledge is acquired.</p>

<p>In this study, we will ask you to read some words or sentences, or look at some images or videos. You will be asked to provide your judgment about these materials, make a selection given certain instructions, or follow the experimenter's directions to perform some action with the materials. Your reaction time may be monitored. You may provide your consent to be audio and/or video-recorded. Over the course of this particular study, approximately 20 to 100 participants will participate. The study lasts between 20 and 45 minutes. </p>

<p>Participation in this study is voluntary. You will be minimally compensated (less than $2) for your participation in this study, as specified on the site running the study. While your linguistic skills are not likely to improve from participation in this research, your responses may provide uswith valuable data about the process of child language acquisition and development, and the nature of the adult grammar and language processor.</p>

<p>There are no foreseeable risks to participation in this study. You may choose not to participate, and you may withdraw at any time during the study procedures without any penalty to you. In addition, you may choose not to answer any questions with which you are not entirely comfortable.</p>

<p>This research is confidential. <i>Confidential</i> means that we will collect information from you, including your gender, age, race and ethnicity, other expertise, and possibly your IP address. This information will not be used to identify you in any way, and your IP address will not be used for any purposes other than to ensure that you do not participate in the same study twice. Responses and demographic information are collected for all participants and analyzed to report trends across participants. If you agree to take part in the study, you will be assigned an arbitrary code that will be associated with your data. Your name will not be linked to this code, so there will be no way to link your responses or demographic information back to you personally. </p>

<p>We keep all participant information confidential by storing it in a secured location (in locked cabinets and on password protected computers) available only to limited laboratory personnel. The research team and the Institutional Review Board at Rutgers University are the only parties that will be allowed to see the data, except as may be required by law. If a report of this study is published, or the results are presented at a professional conference, only group results will be stated, unless you have agreed otherwise. Should an individual response be used as example, personal identifying information will be removed beforehand.</p>

<p>This informed consent form was approved by the Rutgers University Institutional Review Board for the Protection of Human Subjects on 3/5/2018; approval of this form expires on 3/4/2019.</p>
