<h1> Instructions</h1><p><i>Please read the following instructions carefully before beginning.</i></p>

<p>In the following screens, you will read a series of short scenarios one by one.</p>

<p><b>Read each one carefully.</b> 
  In each scenario, characters will ask questions and give answers. 
  At the end, there will be a multiple choice question. 
  Respond to the question based on the corresponding story.</p>
 
<p>Sometimes you will be asked whether a sentence is 'acceptable'. 
  A sentence is acceptable when it is something you might say in daily speech with friends or family.</p>

<p>The first two stories are practice.</p>
