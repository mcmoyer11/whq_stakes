              <p>In order to facilitate our research, we are interested in knowing certain factors about you. Specifically, we are interested in whether you actually take the time to read the directions;  if not, then the data we collect based on your responses will be invalid.  So, in order to demonstrate that you have read the instructions, please ignore the next question (i.e. don't answer it), and simply type the number "1" in the box labeled "Any comments or questions?" Thank you very much.</p>
